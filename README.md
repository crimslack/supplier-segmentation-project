supplier-segmentation-project
Supplier segmentation using hierarchical clustering and PCA for data-driven procurement strategy.

📌 Project Summary
This project applies hierarchical clustering to group suppliers based on performance metrics such as quality, service, cost, and delivery time.
The clustering results are visualized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to aid interpretation.
The main goal is to support procurement decisions through data-driven analysis.
(Note: Cluster count can be adjusted for more detailed insights.)
